    <p>Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that allows for peer-to-peer transactions over the internet. It was created in 2009 by an anonymous person or group of people using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin operates on a technology called blockchain, which is a public ledger that records all transactions.</p>

    <h2 id="privacy">Privacy</h2>
    <p>Privacy in the digital age refers to the right of individuals to control their personal information and data. In the context of cryptocurrencies, privacy is crucial as it protects users from surveillance and potential misuse of their financial information. Various technologies and practices are employed to enhance privacy, including encryption and privacy-focused cryptocurrencies like Monero.</p>
